# Installation README file

This folder contains installation scripts for the programs that are used
in my dotfiles. Many of the scripts are linked to specific programs and
so it was worthwhile adding a list of these main programs used in an
installation script. This way when ever i get on a new machine i can
pull down the dotfiles and run the install script. Other scripts in this
directory are for other programs i use all the time that i might want on
a fresh install. In the future this directory will also contain some
ansible playbooks for quick installation.
